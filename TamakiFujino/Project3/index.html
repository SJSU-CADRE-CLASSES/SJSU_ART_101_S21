“What could this single thread <br>
Ever become?” I said <br>
That was before I realized <br>
What was beyond the scope of my eyes <br><br>

You are like a vertically-sown thread <br>
I am like a horizontal one <br>
And we weave a tapestry <br>
One whose destiny could be <br>
To cover up somebody’s wound, helping it heal </p>
