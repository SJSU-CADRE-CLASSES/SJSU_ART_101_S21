For this project, I wanted to go back what I was really excited about when I decided to change major to DMA three years ago. <br>
I was inspired by "Text Rain" by Camile Utterback and Romy Achituv. I saw the piece when I took Art 75, I was shocked how digital media art is different from what I knew.
Since that moment, I have been trying to pursue my skill to make art interactive. <br><br>
The idea of this project also has emerged from the idea of the binary system I have been working on. I wanted to interact with the sound and reveal that music or language is the accumulation of points.
<br><br>
Rain has been the important object to me, as I used it for the main page of my portfolio, because it is the representation of education, nurture theory, and the circle of life.
I used PoseNet and intersect function to create a trigger for sound. The sound is generated by monoSynth. The notes are listed below.
You move your body and when the white dots that track your movement hit the rain drop, it will generate sound. As a whole you will create a music by moving your body.
